# Premium Case

:::info
  This guide is for the premium case. If you have the standard case, please skip this page and move on to the next step.
:::

If you opted for a premium case, it's now time to assemble it, otherwise move on to the next step. This guide will walk you through the process of putting the case together.

## Installing the Switch Interface

:::caution
  The switch interface is an optional part of the premium case. It can be tricky to install, so please follow the instructions carefully. If you're not comfortable with this step, you can skip it.
:::

Take the bag of black plastic parts and take out the big oval shaped pieces. In each side of the case, push the oval piece into the hole from the inside. Keep the small hole on the side closest to the USB-C port.

Next, set the case down on a flat surface with the keycap side facing down. In each side, place the switch interfaces into the oval pieces. The small button should have the lip facing towards the table. The larger switch can be placed in either orientation, but note if it's pushed "up" or "down", as this will affect placing the PCB in the case.

## Placing the PCB in the Case

Once the switch interface is in place, you can put the PCB into the case. Make sure that the power switch on the PCB matches the position of the switch interface. Both up or both down.

Carefully place the PCB straight down into the case with the electronics facing down. The PCB should fall into place. Do NOT apply pressure to the PCB to push it into place, as this will likely damage the switch interface.

You will know it is in place when the USB-C port and display covers are flush with the case. If the PCB is not flush, remove it and try again.

## Installing the back plate

Once the PCB is in place, you can install the back plate. Each back plate has grooves for rubber feet. These grooves should be facing up to the outside of the case. Place the back plate on the case and grab the **flat** head screws. Screw the back plate into the case. The round screws are for the display covers.

## Adding the rubber feet

Once the back plate is installed, you can add the rubber feet. Peel the backing off of the rubber feet and place them in the grooves on the back plate.

## Wrap Up

Your case is now fully assembled! Move on to the next guides to install switches and keycaps. Feel free to skip over the generic case assembly guide.
